I am a PhD student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &
Engineering at the University of Washington, where I work with the
Programming Languages and Software Engineering (PLSE) group.
Click [here](https://uwplse.org) for more info. I do research in AI
(abstract interpretation).

Programmer productivity is my main interest;
I am currently investigating ways to make software verification easy and
practical for programmers.
I believe _incorrect_ code should be harder to write than _correct_ code in
the first place.
Outside the ivory tower, I've gotten my feet wet in industry,
most recently as an [applied science](https://www.amazon.science) intern with
the AWS Privacy & Security Automation group.
In the past, I've had the privilege to work at a variety of places,
ranging from small startups with 4 backend developers, to behemoths like
[@twitter](https://github.com/twitter).

Before all that, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science at
[@ubc](https://www.ubc.ca), where my thesis investigated how
[developers investigate data-flow reachability questions](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0421073?o=0),
working on user interfaces and IDEs was fun!
