I am a PhD student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &
  Engineering at the University of Washington, where I work with the
  Programming Languages and Software Engineering (PLSE) group.

I do research in AI (abstract interpretation).

Programmer productivity is my main interest.
This takes me to a lot of exciting places,
  ranging from ways to make software verification [easy and practical for programmers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3691620.3695036),
  to thinking about how programming might look like in the future with AI-assisted
  programming tools and prompt-based software engineering.
Outside the ivory tower,
  I've gotten my feet wet in industry,
  most recently as an [applied science](https://www.amazon.science) intern with
  the [AWS Provable Security group](https://aws.amazon.com/security/provable-security/)
  (though back then, it was known as AWS Privacy & Security Automation).
In the past,
  I've had the privilege to work at a variety of places,
  ranging from small startups with 4 backend developers,
  to behemoths like [@twitter](https://github.com/twitter).

Before all that, I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science at
  [@ubc](https://www.ubc.ca),
  where my thesis investigated how [developers investigate data-flow reachability questions](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0421073?o=0),
  working on user interfaces and IDEs was fun!
