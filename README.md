## Hi there 👋

I'm currently a Master of Science student at UBC, studying how we can build tools that empower developers to build software systems that are easier to reason about and safer to deploy. Before that, I worked at [@hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) where I had way too much fun writing Scala and earning an actual living wage in Vancouver.

Writing code is an extremely creative process for me, I feel that I'm able to express myself in ways that I would struggle to in other mediums. My current interests are
* Software + programming language design 💻
* Cycling 🚲
* Computer science education 🎓 
* Craft beer 🍺

I strongly believe in giving back to the greater community, especially via mentorship. I wouldn't have gotten where I am today without the support of countless people who've helped me along the way. If you're interested in chatting about any of the topics I've listed above, feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yoo_hoo_yoo).
