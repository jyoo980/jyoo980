I am currently working toward a Masters degree in Computer Science at [@ubc](https://www.ubc.ca).
Most recently, I worked as a software developer intern with the Privacy and Data Protection Engineering team at 
[@twitter](https://github.com/twitter), endeavouring to make data at Twitter usable, discoverable, and compliant.
Before that, I was a software developer intern at [@hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/).
