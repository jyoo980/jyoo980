Hi there 👋

I'm currently a developer at Hootsuite, where I get to work with a great group of people, and write a ton of Scala. I'm a recent graduate of the computer science department at UBC, and will be returning in the fall to pursue a Masters degree.

Writing code is an extremely creative process for me, I feel that I'm able to express myself in ways that I would struggle to in other mediums. My current interests are
* Software + programming language design 💻
* Cycling 🚲
* Computer science education 🎓 

I strongly believe in giving back to the greater community, especially via mentorship. I wouldn't have gotten where I am today without the support of countless people who've helped me along the way. If you're interested in chatting about any of the topics I've listed above, feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yoo_hoo_yoo)
