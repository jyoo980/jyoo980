I am currently working toward a Masters degree in Computer Science at [@ubc](https://www.ubc.ca).
This summer, I'm working as a software developer intern with the Data Managment Organization at 
[@twitter](https://github.com/twitter), endeavouring to make data at Twitter usable, discoverable, and compliant.
Before that, I was a software developer intern at [@hootsuite](https://www.hootsuite.com/).

Writing code is an extremely creative endeavour for me, I feel that I'm able to express myself in ways that I would struggle to in other mediums. My current interests are
* Software + programming language design 💻
* Cycling 🚲
* Craft beer 🍺

I strongly believe in giving back to the greater community, especially via mentorship. I wouldn't have gotten where I am today without the support of countless people who've helped me along the way. If you're interested in chatting about any of the topics I've listed above, feel free to DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yoo_hoo_yoo).
